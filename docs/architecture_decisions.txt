1. Persons API:

- Because this is the primary API in the Udaconnect application.Separation from the API bundle makes sense. 
- This also aids in the scaling of the Backend based on the website's traffic.


2. Location API:

- Based on the location ID, the Location API is used to extract the location from the database.
- It will have less traffic than Persons API, so it seems reasonable to keep it separate from API Bundle.


3. Location Producer:

- Because the location data is captured from the mobile device, it's a GRPC-based Kafka Producer.
- The traffic on these endpoints will be significantly increased, and Kafka will assist in the handling of a big amount data.


4. Location Consumer:

- A Kafka Consumer is a programme that reads data from a Kafka queue and writes it to a database.
